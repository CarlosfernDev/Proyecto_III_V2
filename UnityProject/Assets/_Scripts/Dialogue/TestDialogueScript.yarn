It has been a long time since the last time 
I went to see how the other islands are but...
due to the destruction of the crystal,
all the bridges that connected the islands between them have been destroyed.
I would repair them by myself but, as you can see
I don’t have enough power to do it
because we, the elementals,
are using all our energy on sustaining the last pieces of the crystal together.
